# SDA-comparing-two-cellular-plans
Statistical Data Analysis for two cellular plans of Megaline carrier.  
The Megaline company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more 
revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
We carried out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection of 500 customers in 2018. 
Our job was to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
